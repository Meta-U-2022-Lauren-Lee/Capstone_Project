# Capstone_Project
App Idea: An app where you can keep track/build a map of the hikes you’ve done and share with friends

Features:
- Home page with posts of hikes from your friends
- Profile page with your hikes, friends, etc.
- Post a hike page where you can post/add hikes that you’ve done
- Search page where you can find hikes near you
- If you find the trail, you can add it to your plan or a wishlist and if you did it you can mark it as done or post it
